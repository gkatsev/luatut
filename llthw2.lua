-- Here's a piece of comment that describes what the program does.
-- The following line of code prints out some text
print("Some random text...")
-- Two dashes found in a print text are not comments
print("-- This will still print")

print("there's a comment after this") -- Comments can also come after the code

-- In fact, everything that comes after -- in code not inside of text are comments


print('print(-- "Hello there")') -- this doesn't work because the second ) is commented out

-- `print -- ("hello world")` doesn't work because it needs to be called.
